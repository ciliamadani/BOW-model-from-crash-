(i realize\\nthis is a real subjective question, but i've only played around with the\\nmachines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody\\nwho actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).\\n\\n* how well does hellcats perform?  ;)\\n\\nthanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i'll post a\\nsummary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the\\ncorner... :( )\\n--\\nTom Willis  \\  twillis@ecn.purdue.edu    \\    Purdue Electrical Engineering\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies.\"  - F.
